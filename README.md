### Time-Series_Stream_Clustering_on_London_Smart_Meter_Dataset
This project implements a prototype of time-series clustering of Smart Meter Dataset using different clustering techniques and distance metrics for better understanding of the smart meter distribution among different clusters.

#### DATASET
* The London Smart Meters dataset contains 1130 smart meters data from 1/1/2013 0:00 to 1/1/2014 0:00 at 30 minutes interval. Along with the smart meters, the dataset contains the acorn distribution of every smart meter.
* For each smart meter, the respective Tariff category (i.e. Standard, Dynamic Time of Use (dToU) etc.), Acorn Category (i.e. ACORN-H, ACORN-N, ACORN-Q, etc.: Total: 19) and Acorn Group (i.e. Comfortable, Adversity, Affluent, and ACORN-U, Total:4 ) are mentioned in the dataset.
